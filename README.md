# CSharp Exploration

This is a playground and educational project where I try to implement and understand new features of the C# programming
language.

## Included feature implementations

- Primary constructors (C# 12)
- Collection expressions (C# 12)
- 'ref readonly' parameters (C# 12)
- Default lambda parameters (C# 12)
- Inline arrays (C# 12)
- Experimental attribute (C# 12)
